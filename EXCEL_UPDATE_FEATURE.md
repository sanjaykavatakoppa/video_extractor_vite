# 📝 Excel Auto-Update Feature

## ✨ New Feature: Automatic Excel Status Updates

After each video download, the Excel file (`video.xlsx`) is automatically updated with the download status!

---

## 📊 How It Works

### New Column: "Download Status"

The system automatically:
1. **Creates** the "Download Status" column if it doesn't exist (added to the end)
2. **Updates** the status for each row after download attempt

### Status Values:

| Status | Meaning | When It Appears |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `Downloaded` | ✅ Successfully downloaded | Video downloaded and saved |
| `Error: [message]` | ❌ Download failed | Any error occurred |
| `Error: No Clip ID` | ❌ Missing data | No Clip ID in that row |
| _(empty)_ | ⏳ Not yet processed | Not attempted yet |

## 🎨 UI Indicators

### Success Badge:

```

The **📝 badge** indicates Excel was updated!

### In Excel:
Open `video.xlsx` and check the "Download Status" column - it will show "Downloaded" for completed videos.

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Column Detection:
- Searches for existing "Download Status" column
- If not found, creates it automatically at the end
- Case-insensitive search

### Update Timing:
- Updated **after** successful download
- Updated **after** error occurs
- NOT updated if download is interrupted

### File Safety:
- Uses XLSX library's safe write methods
- Preserves all existing data and formatting
- Only modifies the specific status cell

---

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Download and Track:
1. Download videos from row 1-5
2. Check Excel - rows 1-5 now show "Downloaded"
3. Next time, start from row 6 to continue

### Resume After Error:
1. Download fails on row 15
2. Excel shows "Error: No comp rendition"
3. Fix the issue or skip row 15
4. Resume from row 16

### Batch Processing:
1. Download 10 videos from row 1
2. Excel updated for all 10 rows
3. Download next 10 from row 11
4. Excel has complete history

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ✅ Excel file is saved after **each** video (safe for interruptions)
- ✅ Original data is **never deleted** - only status column is updated
- ✅ If column exists, it reuses it (doesn't create duplicates)
- ✅ Error messages are **truncated** to 50 characters to fit nicely
