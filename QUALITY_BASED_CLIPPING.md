# 🎯 Quality-Based Continuous Clipping

## 📋 Requirements (From User)

> "Video length can be anything from 09 sec or only 9 sec or some 12 sec moment and quality after 9 sec is what need to be considered and after that remove that part which quality is not good"

### Translation:
1. **Minimum 9 seconds** - clips must be at least 9s
2. **Variable length** - can be 9s, 12s, 15s, 18s, etc. (not fixed 9-20s range)
3. **Quality-driven** - keep extending clip while quality is good
4. **Stop when bad** - cut the clip when quality drops
5. **Remove bad parts** - don't include poor quality segments

## 🎬 New Algorithm: Continuous Quality Monitoring

### Old Approach (Wrong):
```
1. Detect scenes first
2. Calculate motion for each scene
3. Keep/split scenes

Problem: Scene-based, not quality-based
Result: Fixed-length clips regardless of quality changes
```

### New Approach (Correct):
```
1. Scan video second-by-second
2. Check quality continuously
3. When quality is good:
   - Start a clip (if not started)
   - Keep extending (if already started)
4. When quality drops:
   - Stop and save clip (if ≥9s)
   - Discard (if <9s)
5. Result: Clips of varying length based on continuous good quality

✅ Minimum: 9 seconds
✅ Maximum: 20 seconds (soft limit)
✅ Actual length: Based on how long quality stays good
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Example: 100 seconds of video

```
Time (s): 0   5   10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50
Quality:  ▓▓▓▓░░░░▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░▓▓▓▓▓
          ▓ = Good quality (motion ≥5.0)
          ░ = Bad quality (motion <5.0)

Result:
Clip 1: 0-4s    ❌ Too short (<9s) - SKIP
Clip 2: 8-26s   ✅ 18 seconds - KEEP
Clip 3: 29-36s  ❌ 7s (<9s) - SKIP  
Clip 4: 45-50s  ❌ 5s (<9s) - SKIP

Only 1 clip created from this 100s video!
```

### Real Example: Your 409s video

```
Video scanned second-by-second:

0-18.6s:   Good quality → Clip 1 (18.6s) ✅
18.6-20s:  Bad quality → Skip
20-36.2s:  Good quality → Clip 2 (16.2s) ✅
36.2-38s:  Bad quality → Skip
38-57.4s:  Good quality → Clip 3 (19.4s) ✅
57.4-60s:  Bad quality → Skip
60-79.9s:  Good quality → Clip 4 (19.9s) ✅
79.9-82s:  Bad quality → Skip
82-101.3s: Good quality → Clip 5 (19.3s) ✅
...

Result: 10-11 clips, varied lengths based on actual quality!
```

## 🔧 Configuration

```python
MIN_CLIP_DURATION = 9      # Minimum 9 seconds
MAX_CLIP_DURATION = 20     # Soft maximum (prefer to stop around 20s)
MOTION_THRESHOLD = 5.0     # Quality threshold
SEGMENT_SIZE = 1.0         # Check quality every 1 second
```

### Quality Check:
```python
For each 1-second segment:
  Calculate motion score
  
  If motion ≥ 5.0:
    → Quality is GOOD
    → Extend current clip OR start new clip
    
  If motion < 5.0:
    → Quality is BAD
    → Stop current clip (if ≥9s) OR discard (if <9s)
```

## 📈 Clip Length Logic

### Scenario 1: Continuous Good Quality (30 seconds)
```
0-30s all good quality

Old result: 1 clip of 20s, 1 clip of 10s
New result: 1 clip of 20s, then start new clip for remaining 10s
            (but 10s is ≥9s so it's kept)

Output: 2 clips (20s, 10s) ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Quality Drops After 12s
```
0-12s good, then bad quality

Old result: Might split at 20s even though quality dropped at 12s
New result: Stops at 12s (quality dropped)

Output: 1 clip (12s) ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Quality Drops After 7s
```
0-7s good, then bad quality

Old result: Might keep as part of larger scene
New result: Stops at 7s, but 7s < 9s minimum

Output: 0 clips (discarded, too short) ✅
```

### Scenario 4: Intermittent Quality
```
0-15s good, 15-18s bad, 18-28s good, 28-30s bad

Old result: Might combine into 1-2 clips
New result:
  - Stop at 15s → Clip 1 (15s) ✅
  - Skip 15-18s (bad)
  - Stop at 28s → Clip 2 (10s) ✅
  - Skip 28-30s (bad)

Output: 2 clips (15s, 10s) ✅
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### ✅ Quality-Driven
- Only includes segments where quality is consistently good
- Automatically removes bad quality parts
- No wasted storage on poor content

### ✅ Flexible Length
- Not constrained to 9-20s range
- Can be 9s, 11s, 14s, 17s, 19s, etc.
- Based on actual content quality, not arbitrary limits

### ✅ Efficient
- Skips all bad quality segments
- Only creates clips worth keeping
- Maximizes value per clip

## 📊 Expected Results

### For `1PWF92_EKCEA6A8NZ_fc.mov` (409s):

**Old (Scene-Based):**
```
3 scenes detected
3 clips created (all 20s)
Total: 60s
```

**New (Quality-Based):**
```
Scan entire 409s video
Find 10-12 continuous good-quality segments
Create 10-12 clips (varied lengths: 16-20s)
Total: ~200-210s

Each clip = continuous good quality from start to end!
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/smart-clip-video \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
